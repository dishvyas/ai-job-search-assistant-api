## Milestone 1 — Application Tailoring Contract

Defines the API contract for the core AI workflow: tailoring a resume and generating application materials for a specific job. The tailoring response is **mocked and deterministic** — no LLM is called yet.

**What's included:**
- `POST /api/v1/applications/tailor` endpoint
- Pydantic request/response schemas for the full tailoring workflow
- Deterministic mock service that returns realistic structured output
- Validation: empty `master_resume` or `job_description` returns 422
- 8 new tests covering success path and validation errors

**New endpoint:**

```
POST /api/v1/applications/tailor
```

**Example request body:**

```json
{
  "master_resume": "Software engineer with 5 years of Python experience...",
  "job_description": "Looking for a backend engineer to build scalable APIs...",
  "company_info": "A fast-growing fintech startup.",
  "user_preferences": "Prefer to emphasize system design experience."
}
```

**Example curl:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/applications/tailor \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "master_resume": "Software engineer with 5 years of Python experience in distributed systems.",
    "job_description": "Looking for a backend engineer to build scalable APIs using FastAPI."
  }'
```

> Note: The tailoring response is mocked and deterministic. Real LLM integration (Gemini / OpenAI) will replace the mock service in a future milestone.

## Milestone 2 — LLM Provider Abstraction

Introduces a clean abstraction layer between the service logic and the LLM vendor. The app ships with a **mock provider as the default** — no API key required. Gemini can be switched on with a single environment variable.

**What's included:**
- `app/llm/base.py` — `LLMProvider` abstract base class with a single `generate_text` method
- `app/llm/mock.py` — `MockLLMProvider` for tests and local development (deterministic, no network calls)
- `app/llm/gemini.py` — `GeminiLLMProvider` backed by `google-genai` SDK
- `app/llm/factory.py` — `get_llm_provider()` reads `LLM_PROVIDER` from config and returns the right instance
- `app/prompts/tailoring.py` — `build_tailoring_prompt()` assembles a structured prompt from the request
- Updated `app/services/application_tailoring.py` — calls the prompt builder and LLM provider; embeds provider output in the response
- 13 new tests covering factory, mock provider, prompt builder, and endpoint integration

**New environment variables:**

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `LLM_PROVIDER` | `mock` | `mock` or `gemini` |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | _(empty)_ | Required only when `LLM_PROVIDER=gemini` |
| `GEMINI_MODEL` | `gemini-1.5-flash` | Gemini model name |

**Running in mock mode (default — no setup needed):**

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

**Running with Gemini:**

```bash
# 1. Install the SDK
pip install google-genai

# 2. Set env vars in .env
LLM_PROVIDER=gemini
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-key-here

# 3. Start the server
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

> Gemini is entirely optional. All tests run against the mock provider and do not require an API key.

## Milestone 3 — LLM Error Handling & Fallback

Adds production-style resilience so provider failures (503 high demand, 429 rate limit, network errors) never crash the API. The endpoint always returns a valid `ApplicationTailorResponse`.

**What's included:**
- `app/llm/exceptions.py` — `LLMProviderError` base and `LLMProviderUnavailableError` subclass
- `app/llm/gemini.py` — all runtime SDK exceptions are now wrapped in `LLMProviderUnavailableError`
- `app/services/application_tailoring.py` — `_generate_with_fallback()` helper: tries the configured provider, falls back to `MockLLMProvider` on `LLMProviderError`
- Response signals degraded mode: `tailored_summary` and `fit_gap_analysis` include `"Fallback mode used"` when fallback occurred
- 10 new tests covering exception hierarchy, Gemini error wrapping, fallback logic, and endpoint resilience

**Fallback behavior:**

| Scenario | Provider called | Response |
|---|---|---|
| `LLM_PROVIDER=mock` | `MockLLMProvider` | Normal mock output |
| Gemini succeeds | `GeminiLLMProvider` | Real LLM output |
| Gemini raises `LLMProviderError` | Falls back to `MockLLMProvider` | `"Fallback mode used"` visible in response |
| Programming error (e.g. `TypeError`) | Not caught | 500 — intentional |

**What is intentionally not included:**
- Retries or exponential backoff (planned for a future milestone)
- A dedicated `is_fallback` field in the response schema (planned alongside response metadata)
- Tests that call the real Gemini API — all tests use monkeypatching and remain fully offline

---

---

## Milestone 4 — Structured LLM Output

Moves from "embed raw LLM text into the response" to a proper **parse → validate → map** pipeline. The LLM is now instructed to return valid JSON, which is parsed and schema-validated before being mapped into the API response.

**Why structured outputs matter for backend AI systems:**
Raw LLM text is unpredictable. A production backend needs a contract: if the AI doesn't produce the shape you expect, the system should detect it and respond safely rather than returning garbage or crashing.

**What's included:**
- `app/schemas/llm_output.py` — `TailoringLLMOutput` Pydantic model: the internal schema the LLM targets
- `app/llm/parsing.py` — `parse_tailoring_response()`: parses JSON, validates against `TailoringLLMOutput`, raises `LLMOutputParsingError` on failure
- `app/llm/exceptions.py` — `LLMOutputParsingError` added (separate from `LLMProviderError`)
- `app/llm/mock.py` — now returns deterministic valid JSON matching the schema
- `app/prompts/tailoring.py` — prompt updated to instruct the LLM to return JSON only (no markdown, no prose)
- `app/services/application_tailoring.py` — `_get_llm_output()` replaces old helper; maps parsed output directly into the response
- 15 new tests covering parser happy/error paths, mock JSON validity, fallback on parse failure

**Parsing fallback behavior:**

| Scenario | Outcome |
|---|---|
| Provider returns valid JSON | Parsed, validated, mapped to response |
| Provider returns malformed JSON | `LLMOutputParsingError` → fallback to mock |
| Provider unavailable (`LLMProviderError`) | Fallback to mock (unchanged from M3) |
| Mock provider output is invalid | Exception raised — this is a code bug, not a runtime condition |

**What is intentionally not included:**
- Gemini-native structured output mode (e.g. `response_schema` parameter) — prompt-level JSON instruction is simpler and provider-agnostic
- JSON repair / partial parsing — if the LLM returns malformed output, we fall back rather than guess
- Tests that call the real Gemini API — all tests use monkeypatching and remain fully offline

## Milestone 5 — Application Persistence

Adds a database layer so every tailoring run (inputs + AI outputs + metadata) is persisted. SQLite is the default for local development; PostgreSQL is supported by changing one environment variable.

**What's included:**
- `app/db/base.py` — SQLAlchemy `DeclarativeBase`
- `app/db/session.py` — engine, `SessionLocal`, `get_db()` FastAPI dependency
- `app/models/application.py` — `ApplicationTailoringRun` ORM model
- `app/repositories/application_runs.py` — `create_application_tailoring_run()` and `get_application_tailoring_run()`
- `app/schemas/application.py` — `ApplicationTailoringRunResponse` read schema (does not expose raw resume/JD)
- `app/services/application_tailoring.py` — now accepts `db: Session`, tracks `provider_used` / `fallback_used`, saves run after generation
- `app/api/v1/routes/applications.py` — `GET /api/v1/applications/runs/{run_id}` added
- `alembic/` — migration setup; one migration creates the `application_tailoring_runs` table
- `tests/conftest.py` — autouse fixtures create a fresh in-memory SQLite DB per test and override `get_db`; all 60 tests run fully offline

**New endpoint:**
```
GET /api/v1/applications/runs/{run_id}
```
Returns `ApplicationTailoringRunResponse` — includes AI output, `provider_used`, `fallback_used`, and `created_at`.

**Environment variable:**
```
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./local.db          # default (local dev)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg://...      # PostgreSQL (production)
```

**Migration commands:**
```bash
# Apply migrations (creates tables)
alembic upgrade head

# Check current migration state
alembic current

# Generate a new migration after model changes
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "describe your change"

# Roll back one migration
alembic downgrade -1
```

**Inspect stored runs (SQLite):**
```bash
sqlite3 local.db "SELECT id, provider_used, fallback_used, created_at FROM application_tailoring_runs;"
```

**What is intentionally not included:**
- User accounts / authentication — runs are not scoped to users yet
- pgvector / embeddings — a future milestone
- Pagination on the runs list endpoint — not added yet
- Async SQLAlchemy — synchronous is simpler and sufficient for this stage
